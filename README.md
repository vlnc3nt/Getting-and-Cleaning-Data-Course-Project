# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

##Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 



This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
